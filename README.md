# Travel Journal

This is part of my React practice series of repos.
This especific repo simulates a travel journal static page.

Concepts applied:
- Component creation
- Css styling
- Fetching data from an external source (data.js). That is the file with all the information of each trip (a array of js objects).
- Vite+React project creation.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
